# How to Build

* `make` or `make all` - build all source files
* `make <source-file-without-extension>` - build individual source file
* `make clean` - clean all built artifacts

for other dedicated testing program, for now go to such directory, then `make`.

GPL-2.0, Wasin Thonkaew

Previously changed from MIT, to GPL-2.0 as most of the ideas of concepts are
inspired from Linux Kernel source code. Source code can be similar to what has
been there in the source code of Linux Kernel, almost it's not pure copy, but
adapted or modified in some ways. Thus to keep it compatible and avoid
breaking the license, this repository opts in to use GPL-2.0 the same.
